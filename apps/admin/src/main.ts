 * waits for its router: mounting first renders one frame of the wrong layout —
 * here, a flash of the whole console behind the sign-in form.
 *
 * No PrimeVue theme preset. This console is a handful of dense operational
 * tables for one or two people, and `theme.css` does the whole job in a file
 * somebody can read — a design system would be more to maintain than the screens
 * it dressed. The deliberate visual distance from the shop's ERP is the point
 * (owner decision 2026-09-03), and a shared preset would work against it.
