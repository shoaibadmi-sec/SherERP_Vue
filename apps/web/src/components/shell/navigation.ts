       * storage check — onto one question about one machine.

       * Sync is now a card on the Offline page. **`/sync` is still a real
       * route**, named in the same activePrefixes as Offline so the sidebar
       * keeps that entry lit while somebody is on it — a route reachable from
       * a page is not a hidden screen (the "Advanced toggle" this decision
       * deliberately refused), and a support call that says "open /sync" still
       * works.
