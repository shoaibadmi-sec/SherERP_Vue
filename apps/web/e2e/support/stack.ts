/**
 * The real stack, on its own database and its own ports (Phase 18.5).
 *
 * The owner's decision was that the E2E suite drives the real thing: the same
 * NestJS API, the same migrations, the same role backfill, the same Vite build
 * step a shopkeeper's browser loads. Nothing here is a stub or an in-memory
 * substitute, because a suite that passes against a substitute proves only that
 * the substitute works.
 *
 * The API is started here rather than through Playwright's `webServer` because
 * the database has to be dropped, migrated and back-filled *before* the process
 * that connects to it exists — and `webServer` gives no ordering guarantee
 * against `globalSetup` that survives a Playwright upgrade.
